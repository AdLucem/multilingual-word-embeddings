# Multilingual Word Embeddings

Mapping monolingual embeddings from a source language to a target language.

The supervised approach using linear regression is described as a blogpost [here](./supervised.org)

The unsupervised approach implements the method given in the paper [A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06297.pdf)
